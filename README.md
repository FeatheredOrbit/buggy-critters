# Buggy Critters - Living within a Computer.
 
## What is this supposed to be?
This is a 2D evolution simulation game built with the [Bevy Engine](https://bevy.org/), or at least it's supposed to be, as it is a barely started project. It involves little bugs within a computer system (haha get it), feeding off the software ecosystem and other bugs and glitches. They will be capable of evolving over time to achieve ridiculous abilities and powers, sending the simulation more in chaos as new generations are born.

## At what point of development is this?
Barely started, you could blow my right hand off and chop a few fingers and I could still count the amount of features on what fingers are left.

## Inspirations?
Heavily inspired by THE BIBITES, made by Léo Caussan. Hopefully it's not plagiarism. Please check out his website:

## How do I build the project?
I don't see why you would want to build the project, but it should be as simple as cloning the repo and running `cargo build`.
